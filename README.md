# StashApp Prometheus Exporter

A Prometheus exporter for StashApp that exposes your library stats, play patterns, and engagement metrics via GraphQL. Perfect for tracking your collection growth, watching habits, and seeing which scenes get the most love.

## Quick Start

```bash
podman run --rm -p 9100:9100 \
  -e STASH_GRAPHQL_URL="http://stash:9999/graphql" \
  -e STASH_API_KEY="your_api_key" \
  ghcr.io/evolite/stashapp-prometheus-exporter:latest
```

That's it! Point Prometheus at `http://localhost:9100/metrics` and you're good to go.

## Configuration

- `STASH_GRAPHQL_URL` - Stash GraphQL endpoint (default: `http://stash:9999/graphql`)
- `STASH_API_KEY` - Your Stash API key (required)
- `EXPORTER_LISTEN_PORT` - Metrics port (default: `9100`)
- `LOG_LEVEL` - Python log level (default: `INFO`)

The exporter uses synchronous scraping - metrics are collected when Prometheus requests them, not on a timer. This means your metrics are always fresh and there's no stale data hanging around.

## Metrics

All metrics are prefixed with `stash_` and follow Prometheus naming conventions. Here's what you get:

### Library Stats

Basic counts of everything in your library:
- `stash_scenes_total` - Total scenes
- `stash_images_total` - Total images  
- `stash_galleries_total` - Total galleries
- `stash_performers_total` - Total performers
- `stash_studios_total` - Total studios
- `stash_tags_total` - Total tags
- `stash_groups_total` - Total groups
- `stash_files_total` - Total files (scenes + images)
- `stash_files_size_bytes` - Total file size in bytes
- `stash_scenes_duration_seconds` - Total scene duration in seconds

### Curation & Coverage

How well-organized is your library? These metrics help you track that:
- `stash_scenes_organized_total` - Scenes marked as organized
- `stash_scenes_with_stashid_total` - Scenes with at least one StashID
- `stash_scenes_tagged_total` - Scenes with at least one tag
- `stash_scenes_with_performers_total` - Scenes with at least one performer
- `stash_scenes_with_studio_total` - Scenes with a studio
- `stash_scenes_watched_total` - Scenes with at least one play
- `stash_scenes_with_markers_total` - Scenes with at least one marker
- `stash_scene_markers_total` - Total number of scene markers

**Pro tip:** Calculate coverage ratios with PromQL:
- StashID coverage: `stash_scenes_with_stashid_total / stash_scenes_total`
- Organization rate: `stash_scenes_organized_total / stash_scenes_total`

### Play Statistics

Track your viewing habits:
- `stash_total_play_count` - Total number of scene plays
- `stash_total_play_duration_seconds` - Total play duration across all scenes
- `stash_scenes_played_total` - Scenes that have at least one recorded play
- `stash_total_o_count` - Total orgasm counter across all scenes

### Playtime Patterns

When do you watch? These metrics break it down:
- `stash_play_duration_seconds_by_dow{day_of_week}` - Play duration by day of week
  - Labels: `Mon`, `Tue`, `Wed`, `Thu`, `Fri`, `Sat`, `Sun`
- `stash_play_duration_seconds_by_hour{hour_of_day}` - Play duration by hour of day
  - Labels: `0` through `23` (24-hour format)

### Tag Usage

See which tags are most popular among your played scenes:
- `stash_tag_usage_count{tag_name}` - Number of played scenes using each tag
  - Only the top 100 tags by usage are exported to limit cardinality

### Orgasm Events

Track orgasm events per scene:
- `stash_scene_o_counter{scene_id, scene_name}` - Current orgasm counter value per scene
  - Only scenes with `o_counter > 0` are exported
  - Use `increase(stash_scene_o_counter[5m])` in PromQL to see new events over time
  - Use `topk(5, stash_scene_o_counter)` to see your top 5 scenes

### Exporter Health

Is the exporter working? These metrics tell you:
- `stash_up` - 1 if the last scrape succeeded, 0 otherwise
- `stash_scrape_duration_seconds` - Time spent on the last scrape
- `stash_scrapes_total{status="success|failure"}` - Total scrape attempts

## Example Queries

```promql
# Your most watched scenes
topk(10, stash_scene_o_counter)

# New orgasm events in the last hour
sum(increase(stash_scene_o_counter[1h]))

# Play duration by day of week
stash_play_duration_seconds_by_dow

# Library growth rate
rate(stash_scenes_total[1d])
```

## Dashboard

Check out `dashboards/stashapp-overview.json` for a ready-to-use Grafana dashboard that visualizes all these metrics. Just import it into Grafana and you're set!

## How It Works

The exporter queries your Stash instance via GraphQL and exposes metrics using Prometheus's custom Collector pattern. This means:
- **Synchronous scraping** - Metrics are fresh when Prometheus requests them
- **No stale labels** - Deleted scenes/tags automatically disappear
- **Fully stateless** - No cached data between scrapes

All queries are based on the [public Stash GraphQL API documentation](https://docs.stashapp.cc/api).

## Building

Images are automatically built and pushed to GHCR on pushes to `main` and version tags. You can also build locally:

```bash
podman build -t stashapp-exporter .
```

Happy monitoring! 📊
