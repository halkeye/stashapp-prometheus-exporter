# StashApp Prometheus Exporter

A Prometheus exporter for StashApp that exposes your library stats, play patterns, and engagement metrics via GraphQL. Perfect for tracking your collection growth, watching habits, and seeing which scenes get the most love.

## Quick Start

```bash
podman run --rm -p 9100:9100 \
  -e STASH_GRAPHQL_URL="http://stash:9999/graphql" \
  -e STASH_API_KEY="your_api_key" \
  ghcr.io/evolite/stashapp-prometheus-exporter:latest
```

Point Prometheus at `http://localhost:9100/metrics` and you're good to go.

## Configuration

- `STASH_GRAPHQL_URL` - Stash GraphQL endpoint (default: `http://stash:9999/graphql`)
- `STASH_API_KEY` - Your Stash API key (required)
- `EXPORTER_LISTEN_PORT` - Metrics port (default: `9100`)
- `LOG_LEVEL` - Python log level (default: `INFO`)

## Metrics

All metrics are prefixed with `stash_` and follow Prometheus naming conventions. See [METRICS.md](METRICS.md) for detailed documentation of all available metrics.

## Example Queries

```promql
# Top 10 scenes by o-count
topk(10, stash_scene_o_counter)

# Total o-count events in the last hour
sum(increase(stash_scene_o_counter[1h]))

# Average watch time per play
stash_total_play_duration_seconds / clamp_max(stash_total_play_count, 1e9)

# Play duration by day of week (in hours)
stash_play_duration_seconds_by_dow / 3600

# Most active watching hour
topk(1, stash_play_duration_seconds_by_hour)

# Library organization coverage
stash_scenes_organized_total / stash_scenes_total * 100

# Scenes with StashID coverage
stash_scenes_with_stashid_total / stash_scenes_total * 100

# Total library size in GB
stash_files_size_bytes / 1024 / 1024 / 1024

# Average scene duration
stash_scenes_duration_seconds / stash_scenes_total

# Most popular tags (top 10)
topk(10, stash_tag_usage_count)
```

## Dashboard

Check out `dashboards/stashapp-overview.json` for a ready-to-use Grafana dashboard that visualizes all these metrics. Just import it into Grafana and you're set!

All queries are based on the [public Stash GraphQL API documentation](https://docs.stashapp.cc/api).
