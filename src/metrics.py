Prometheus metric definitions and update helpers for the Stash exporter.

Metrics are intentionally low‑cardinality gauges that expose library‑wide
aggregates derived from the Stash GraphQL `stats` query and a small set of
Scene fields.

All metric names follow Prometheus best practices described in:
