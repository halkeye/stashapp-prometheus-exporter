GraphQL queries used by the StashApp Prometheus exporter.

These queries are based on the public Stash GraphQL API documentation
(`https://docs.stashapp.cc/api/?utm_source=openai`) and are intended to
return cheap, aggregated statistics suitable for exporter usage.

If you run a different Stash version or customised schema, validate these
queries in the Stash GraphQL playground (Settings > Tools > GraphQL playground)
and adjust them as needed.
